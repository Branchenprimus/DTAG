Deutsche Telekom
Deutsche Telekom AG (German pronunciation: [ˌdɔʏtʃə
ˈteːləkɔm ʔaːˌɡeː] ; often just Telekom, DTAG or DT;
stylised as ·T·) is a German telecommunications company
headquartered in Bonn and is the largest
telecommunications provider in Europe by revenue. It was
formed in 1995 when Deutsche Bundespost, a state
monopoly at the time, was privatized. Since then, Deutsche
Telekom has consistently featured among Fortune
Magazine's top Global 500 companies by revenue, with its
ranking as of 2023 at number 79.[3] In 2023, the company
was ranked 41st in the Forbes Global 2000.
[4] The company
operates several subsidiaries worldwide, including the
mobile communications brand T-Mobile. It is the world's
fifth-largest telecommunications company by revenue.
As of April  2020, the German government held a direct
14.5% stake in company stock and another 17.4% through
the government bank KfW.
[5] On 4th June 2024, the
German government reduced it’s total shareholding to
27.8%.[a][6] The company is a component of the EURO
STOXX 50 stock market index.
[7]
The Deutsche Bundespost was the German federal
government postal administration created in 1947 as a
successor to the Reichspost. It was also the major telephone
company in West Germany.
On 1 July 1989, as part of a post office reform, Deutsche
Bundespost was split into three entities, one being
Deutsche Telekom. On 1 January 1995, as part of another
reform, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom became Deutsche
Telekom AG, and was privatized in 1996. As such, it shares
a common heritage with the other privatized Deutsche
Bundespost companies, Deutsche Post (DHL) and Deutsche
Postbank.
[8][9]
Deutsche Telekom was the monopoly Internet service
provider (ISP) for Germany until its privatization in 1995,
and the dominant ISP thereafter.[10] Until the early 21st

century, Deutsche Telekom controlled almost all Internet
access by individuals and small businesses in Germany, as
they were one of the first German telecom units.[10]
On 6 December 2001, Deutsche Telekom became the first
official partner of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
[11]
On 1 January 2005, Deutsche Telekom implemented a new
company structure. The two organizational business units
of T-Com and T-Online were merged into the
Broadband/Fixed Network (BBFN) strategic business unit
(T-Online merged with parent Deutsche Telekom in 2006).
It provides around 40 million narrowband lines, over 9
million broadband lines, and has 14 million registered
Internet customers.
In 2008, the structure was changed again. T-Online was
separated from Deutsche Telekom and merged with T-Com
to form the new unit T-Home. In September 2010, Orange
parent France Télécom and T-Mobile parent Deutsche
Telekom merged their operations in the United Kingdom to
create the largest mobile network in Britain, EE.
[12]
In April 2010, T-Mobile was merged with T-Home to form
Telekom Deutschland GmbH. This unit now handles all
products and services aimed at private customers. In
October 2012, Deutsche Telekom and Orange created a 50-
50% joint venture named BuyIn for regrouping their
procurement operations and benefiting from economies of
scale.
[13]
In April 2013, T-Mobile US and MetroPCS merged their
operations in the United States.
[14]
In February 2014,
Deutsche Telekom acquired the remaining parts of its TMobile Czech Republic division for around €800 million.
The size of the remaining stake was numbered at 40
percent.[15]
In December 2014, it was announced that Deutsche
Telekom were in talks with BT Group on the acquisition of
EE, and part of the deal was to provide Deutsche Telekom a
12% stake and a seat on the board in the BT Group upon
completion.[16][17] BT Group announced agreement in
February 2015 to acquire EE for £12.5 billion[18] and
received regulatory approval from the Competition and
Markets Authority on 15 January 2016.[19]
 The transaction was completed on 29 January 2016.[20]
In September 2015, Deutsche Telekom launched the "Puls tablet", a Tablet computer with Android
version 5.
[21][22]

In February 2016, at the Mobile World Congress, in Barcelona,
Deutsche Telekom jointly launched the Telecom Infra Project
(TIP) with Intel, Nokia, Facebook, Equinix, SK Telecom, and
others, which builds on the Open Compute Project model to
accelerate innovation in the telecom industry.[23]
Amid concerns over Chinese involvement in 5G wireless
networks in Europe, Deutsche Telekom temporarily put all
deals to buy 5G network equipment on hold in 2019, as it
awaited the resolution of a debate in Germany over whether to ban Chinese vendor Huawei on
security grounds.[24]
In February 2020, Deutsche Telekom joined a new partnership called HAPS Alliance to promote
the use of high-altitude vehicles in the Earth's stratosphere with the goal of eliminating the digital
divide.[25]
On April 1, 2020, Sprint completed the merger with T-Mobile US, making T-Mobile US the owner
of Sprint and becoming its subsidiary until the Sprint brand is phased out. The merger also led
SoftBank Group, the then-owner of Sprint, to hold up to 24% of New T-Mobile's shares while
Deutsche Telekom holds up to 43% of its shares. The remaining 33% is since held by public
shareholders.
In September 2021, Deutsche Telekom sold T-Mobile Netherlands for €5.1 billion to the
investment companies Apax Partners and Warburg Pincus.
[26]
In September 2022, Deutsche Telekom is expanding its activities in the field of blockchain
technology. DT’s subsidiary, T-Systems Multimedia Solutions provides the Ethereum Network
with infrastructure in the form of validation nodes.
[27]
In December 2023, Deutsche Telekom and Nokia with Fujitsu began deploying a multivendor
Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN). The network is fully integrated into Deutsche Telekom's
existing commercial network, including 5G AirScale compatible with Open RAN.[28]
For the fiscal year 2017, Deutsche Telekom reported earnings of €3.5 billion, with an annual
revenue of €74.9 billion, an increase of 2.5% over the previous fiscal cycle.[29] Deutsche Telekom's
shares traded at over €14 per share, and its market capitalization was valued at US$68.4 billion in
November 2018.[30]

to replace the Israeli backend.
